```

## Example usage

Here we will demonstrate how to use `linregasm` in a project to check linear regression assumptions:

```{r setup}
library(linregasm)
```

## Define Sample Data
We will use the `Iris` dataset from the `data` package to demonstrate the functionality of `lrasm.`linregasm`.

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)

```

In our example, we want to investigate the linear relationship between the response Petal.width versus the predictors: Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, and petal width. We start by defining the dataframe and a formula to relate the variables within a linear regression model:

```{r}
formula = "Petal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width + Petal.Length"
iris_df = iris
```

## Test for Homoscedasticity of Residuals

We can evaluate the homoscedasticity of our residuals by passing our data and formula into the function `homoscedasticity()`. Note that 'homoscedasticity' returns two objects, the first one is a plot of residuals vs predicted values, while the second is the p value of the correlation between residuals vs predicted values:

```{r}

hsc_results <- linregasm::homoscedasticity(iris_df, formula)

hsc_results
```

## Test for Normality of Residuals

We can evaluate the normality of our residuals by passing our data and formula into the function `normality()`. Note that `normality()` returns two objects, the first one is a p-value from the Shapiro Wilk test, while the second is a string containing either the word Pass or Fail depending on the results of the test. The function will also print a summary statement.

```{r}

norm_results <- normality(iris_df, formula)

norm_results

```

After applying the Shapiro Wilks test for normality of the residuals, the regression assumption of normality has passed.

## Test for Multicollinearity

We can evaluate the multicollinearity assumption of our data set by passing our data, formula, and the threshold for the VIF value. `multicollinearity()` takes these arguments and returns a data frame with VIF scores for each feature along with the statement advising the user if the multicollinearity assumption is violated.

```{r}
mult_results <- linregasm::multicollinearity(iris_df, formula)

mult_results
```
In this case, since all of our VIF scores were below the threshold of 10, we can conclude that our data satisfies the multicollinearity assumption.
